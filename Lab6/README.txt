This lab implements the data struture. XML tags are used to display the heap tree. The user provides the program with an array in a file. The program takes the numbers in the array and adds them into the heap using headadd(), once all the numbers are added and sorted (heapadd() takes care of the sorting), the numbers are deleted from the heap one by one while making adjustments to the heap tree each time. Once a number is deleted it is pushed into a stack. At the end all the numbers are popped from the stack and the numbers are printed out in order.
