Lab 1 for data structures and algorithms course. The purpose of this lab was to implement the mySort function using C programming. This function 
takes an array as an input and sortes the numbers in an asecending order, using insertion sort. The user inputs the array they want to sort
and the program calls the mySort function, which sorts the array and prints out the output.
